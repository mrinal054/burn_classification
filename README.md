## Burn classification using deep learning

This project classifies 3 types of burn images - 
-  superficial dermal
-  deep dermal
-  full-thickness

Also, this code provides a good understanding of 
keras-tensorflow. One can learn - 
- Sequential model in keras-tensorflow
- early stopping
- saving a model
- getting weights and configurations from a layer
- confidence matrix
- evaluating a model
- plotting accuracy and validation curve
- plotting feature maps
- plotting weight matrix
